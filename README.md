# xbox360-retitler
If you need to modify game on demand titles on your home-brewed xbox 360 console, you're in the right place!

**usage**: open index.html on your favorite internet browser or you can give it a try at: https://oguzalpcakmak.github.io/xbox360-retitler/

**known bugs:**

- it only works for ascii characters! (not utf-8 compatible)

- symbols like ™ are not interpreted correctly so don't use them (but ® works somehow)
